## Support Vector Machines (SVM) Classification â€“ Breast Cancer Dataset
Implemented an SVM-based binary classification model using the Breast Cancer dataset.

    1.Preprocessing: Cleaned data, encoded target labels, and standardized features.
    2.Modeling: Trained SVM with both Linear and RBF kernels.
    3.Optimization: Tuned hyperparameters (C, gamma) using GridSearchCV and evaluated with cross-validation.
    4.Evaluation: Measured performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
    5.Visualization: Reduced data to 2D using PCA and plotted decision boundaries for model interpretation.
    6.Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
